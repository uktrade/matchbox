This document describes how you can get started with developing Matchbox.

## Dependencies

* [Python 3.11+](https://www.python.org)
* [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
* [TruffleHog](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog)
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org)
* [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com)
* [just](https://just.systems/man/en/)

## Setup

Set up environment variables by creating a `.env` file under project directory. See [`/environments/dev_local.env`](https://github.com/uktrade/matchbox/blob/main/environments/dev_local.env) for sensible defaults.

This project is managed by [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), linted and formated with [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/), and tested with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/). [Docker](https://www.docker.com) is used for local development. Documentation is build using [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org).

To install all dependencies for this project, run:

```shell
uv sync --all-extras
```

Secret scanning is done with [TruffleHog](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog).

For security, use of [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) is expected. Ensure your hooks are installed:

```shell
pre-commit install
```

Task running is done with [just](https://just.systems/man/en/). To see all available commands:

```shell
just -l
```

## Run tests

A just task is provided to run all tests.

```shell
just test
```

If you're running tests with some other method, such as your IDE or pytest directly, you'll need to start the local backends and mock warehouse in Docker.

```shell
just build -d --wait
```

## Database Migrations for PostgreSQL backend

Migrations for the PostgreSQL backend are managed by [Alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/).

!!! warning

    Do not make alternations to the database using mechanisms other then Alembic. This will interfere with the migration scripts.

If:

* You have made an alteration to the database through the ORM code, but not yet applied it
* You have run `just build` to ensure the database container is running

Then you can verify a migration script would be created (without creating one) with:

```shell
just migration-check
```

Or actually create the new migration script by running:

```shell
just migration-generate "< enter descriptive message >"
```

These commands will auto-detect the difference between the ORM and the database container.

Check `src/matchbox/server/postgresql/alembic/versions/` for the new migration script and verify that the autogenerate matches your expectation. See the [documentation for known failure modes](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/autogenerate.html#what-does-autogenerate-detect-and-what-does-it-not-detect). 

!!! note

    Migrations are applied automatically by the application as it spins up.


### Applying migrations manually

Sometimes you may wish to apply your migrations manually.

```shell
just migration-apply
```

In Alembic:

* `head` refers to the latest migration script
* `base` refer to the earliest migration script

If you modify the database and need to recover it:


```shell
just migration-reset
just migration-apply
```

## Debugging

We have a VSCode default debugging profile called "API debug", which allows to e.g. set breakpoints on the API when running tests. After running this profile, change your `.env` file  as follows:

- Change the `MB__CLIENT__API_ROOT` variable to redirect tests to use the debug port (`8080`)
- Disable time-outs by commenting out the `MB__CLIENT__TIMEOUT` variable

## Standards

### Code

When contributing to the main matchbox repository and its associated repos, we try to follow consistent standards. Python code should be:

* Unit tested, and pass new and existing tests
* Documented via docstrings, in the [Google style](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html)
* Linted and auto-formatted (`just format`)
* Type hinted (within reason)
* Using env files and dotenv for setting environment variables
* Structured as a Python package with `pyprojects.toml`
* Using dependencies managed automatically by uv
* Integrated with justfile when relevant
* Documented, for example, `README.md` files where relevant

### Git

We commit as frequently as possible. We keep our commits as atomic as possible. We never push straight to main, instead we merge feature branches. Before merging to main, branches are peer reviewed.

!!! warning
    Pre-commit **must** be turned on. Any secrets you commit to the repo are your own responsibility.

### AI

In order to help reviewers prioritise their time appropriately, we expect any use of AI to be declared in your PR comment.
